Things still to implement:

- nagWhich is not properly set on time = 0.
- Make Nag/Warnings only beep if SleepTimer is not the app with focus when the time comes. Commented beeps out totally for now as they're driving me batshit insane -  when I fall asleep and this is active it beeps every 15 minutes and wakes me up.
- Migrate settings to use CoreData
- Change colour of Warning/Nag dialog background colour depending on time to/from the alarm - (first warning) green-yellow-orange (alarm time)-red (warnings)
- Format time to/from alarms in hours:minutes if it's more than 59 minutes
- Change of language: "alarm time" instead of "bed time" throughout app
- Menu item telling program to use the next/previous alarm time as the base instead of the one it's using
- Set some default alarms for new installations
- A debug mode which warns/nags each minute for testing?
- Fix window titles on warn/nags to be the event name
- Better interface for setting alarms and warning/nag times
- For each alarm we want to be able to set:
	- Event Time
	- Event Title ("nap time", "bedtime")
	- Warning Times
	- Nag Times
	- Warning text (can be multi-line)
	- Nag text (can be multi-line)
